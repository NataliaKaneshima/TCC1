abstract = {This paper reveals ten big characteristics (10 Bigs) of big data and explores their non-linear interrelationships through presenting a unified framework of big data. The framework has three levels: fundamental level, technological level, and socio-economic level. The fundamental level has four big fundamental characteristics of big data. The technological level consists of three big technological characteristics of big data. The socioeconomic level has three big socioeconomic characteristics of big data. The paper looks at each level of the proposed framework from a service-oriented perspective. The proposed approach in this paper might facilitate the research and development of big data, big data analytics, business intelligence, and business analytics.},

abstract = {Malicious software, commonly known as malware are constantly getting smarter with the capabilities of undergoing self-modifications. They are produced in big numbers and widely deployed very fast through the Internet-capable devices. This is therefore a big data problem and remains challenging in the research community. Existing detection methods should be enhanced in order to effectively deal with today's malware. In this paper, we propose a novel real-time monitoring, analysis and detection approach that is achieved by applying big data analytics and machine learning in the development of a general detection model. The learnings achieved through big data render machine learning more efficient. Using the deep learning approach, we designed and developed a scalable detection model that brings improvement to the existing solutions. Our experiments achieved an accuracy of 97% and ROC of 0.99.},

abstract = {Recently, two terms, namely Big Data and Internet of Things (IoT) have gained popularity individually. However, their interconnections are not fully explored and understood. It is expected that the fusion of Big Data and IoT would create many complex systems for smart cities. While the data from IoT lies in Big Data, the scale of operations are completely different in terms of providing the required real-time analytics for such smart systems. Even though NoSQL databases and other next generation solutions could be deployed to achieve real-time responses, the major security challenges need to be understood as mission critical and sensitive data intertwines Big Data and IoT. In this paper, we identify the security challenges shared by the closely-knit Big Data and IoT in three main risk areas: i) NoSQL security vulnerabilities, ii) mobile IoT (M-IoT) security and privacy constraints and iii) encryption key security threats. We perform a comparative study of security vulnerabilities of NoSQL databases and identify the security and privacy constraints of M-IoT networks. Encryption key attacks for resource constrained IoT devices are also illustrated mathematically. Overall, this paper explores new research directions in these prime areas of security and privacy that would result in solution opportunities for a meaningful fusion of Big Data and IoT for a smart environment.},

However, very few research work provides a complete survey of the whole pine-line of the multimedia big data analytics, including the management and analysis of the large amount of data, the challenges and opportunities, and the promising research directions. To serve this purpose, we present this survey, which conducts a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art research work on multimedia big data analytics. It also aims to bridge the gap between multimedia challenges and big data solutions by providing the current big data frameworks, their applications in multimedia analyses, the strengths and limitations of the existing methods, and the potential future directions in multimedia big data analytics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey that targets the most recent multimedia management techniques for very large-scale data and also provides the research studies and technologies advancing the multimedia analyses in this big data era.},

abstract = {Big Data Systems (BDSs) are an emerging class of scalable software technologies whereby massive amounts of heterogeneous data are gathered from multiple sources, managed, analyzed (in batch, stream or hybrid fashion), and served to end-users and external applications. Such systems pose specific challenges in all phases of software development lifecycle and might become very complex by evolving data, technologies, and target value over time. Consequently, many organizations and enterprises have found it difficult to adopt BDSs. In this article, we provide insight into three major activities of software engineering in the context of BDSs as well as the choices made to tackle them regarding state-of-the-art research and industry efforts. These activities include the engineering of requirements, designing and constructing software to meet the specified requirements, and software/data quality assurance. We also disclose some open challenges of developing effective BDSs, which need attention from both researchers and practitioners.},

abstract = {Recent cyber attacks have shown that the leakage/stealing of big data may result in enormous monetary loss and damage to organizational reputation, and increased identity theft risks for individuals. Furthermore, in the age of big data, protecting the security and privacy of stored data is paramount for maintaining public trust, and getting the full value from the collected data. In this talk, we first discuss the unique security and privacy challenges arise due to big data and the NoSQL systems designed to analyze big data. Also we discuss our proposed SecureDL system that is built on top of existing NoSQL databases such as Hadoop and Spark and designed as a data access broker where each request submitted by a user app is automatically captured. These captured requests are logged, analyzed and then modified (if needed) to conform with security and privacy policies (e.g.,[5]), and submitted to underlying NoSQL database. Furthermore, SecureDL can allow organizations to audit their big data usage to prevent data misuse and comply with various privacy regulations[2]. SecureDL is totally transparent from the user point of view and does not require any change to the user's code and/or the underlying NoSQL database systems. Therefore, it can be deployed on existing NoSQL databases.Later on, we discuss how to add additional security layer for protecting big data using encryption techniques (e.g., [1, 3, 4]). Especially, we discuss our work on leveraging the modern hardware based trusted execution environments (TEEs) such as Intel SGX for secure encrypted data processing. We also discuss how to provide a simple, secure and high level language based framework that is suitable for enabling generic data analytics for non-security experts who do not have security concepts such as "oblivious execution''. Our proposed framework allows data scientists to perform the data analytic tasks with TEEs using a Python/Matlab like high level language; and automatically compiles programs written in our language to optimal execution code by managing issues such as optimal data block sizes for I/O, vectorized computations to simplify much of the data processing, and optimal ordering of operations for certain tasks. Using these design choices, we show how to provide guarantees for efficient and secure big data analytics over encrypted data.},

abstract = {The global database research community has greatly impacted the functionality and performance of data storage and processing systems along the dimensions that define "big data", i.e., volume, velocity, variety, and veracity. Locally, over the past five years, we have also been working on varying fronts. Among our contributions are: (1) establishing a vision for a database-inspired big data analytics system, which unifies the best of database and distributed systems technologies, and augments it with concepts drawn from compilers (e.g., iterations) and data stream processing, as well as (2) forming a community of researchers and institutions to create the Stratosphere platform to realize our vision. One major result from these activities was Apache Flink, an open-source big data analytics platform and its thriving global community of developers and production users. Although much progress has been made, when looking at the overall big data stack, a major challenge for database research community still remains. That is, how to maintain the ease-of-use despite the increasing heterogeneity and complexity of data analytics, involving specialized engines for various aspects of an end-to-end data analytics pipeline, including, among others, graph-based, linear algebra-based, and relational-based algorithms, and the underlying, increasingly heterogeneous hardware and computing infrastructure. At TU Berlin, DFKI, and the Berlin Big Data Center (BBDC), we aim to advance research in this field via the Mosaics project. Our goal is to remedy some of the heterogeneity challenges that hamper developer productivity and limit the use of data science technologies to just the privileged few, who are coveted experts.},

abstract = {Academic studies exploiting novel data sources are scarce. Typically, data is generated by commercial businesses or government organizations with no mandate and little motivation to share their assets with academic partners---partial exceptions include social messaging data and some sources of open data. The mobilization of citizen sensors at a massive scale has allowed for the development of impressive infrastructures. However, data availability is driving applications---problems are prioritized because data is available rather than because they are inherently important or interesting. The U.K. is addressing this through investments by the Economic and Social Research Council in its Big Data Network. A group of Administrative Data Research Centres are tasked with improving access to data sets in central government, while a group of Business and Local Government Centres are tasked with improving access to commercial and regional sources. This initiative is described. It is illustrated by examples from health care, transport, and infrastructure. In all of these cases, the integration of data is a key consideration. For social science problems relevant to policy or academic studies, it is unlikely all the answers will be found in a single novel data source, but rather a combination of sources is required. Through such synthesis great leaps are possible by exploiting models that have been constructed and refined over extended periods of time e.g., microsimulation, spatial interaction models, agents, discrete choice, and input-output models. Although interesting and valuable new methods are appearing, any suggestion that a new box of magic tricks labeled "Big Data Analytics" that sits easily on top of massive new datasets can radically and instantly transform our long-term understanding of society is na\"{\i}ve and dangerous. Furthermore, the privacy and confidentiality of personal data is a great concern to both the individuals concerned and the data owners.},

Thus, the traditional enterprise security perimeter is disappearing and evolving into the concept of security intelligence where the volume, velocity/rate, and variety of data have dramatically changed. Today, to cope with the fast-changing security landscape, we need to be able to transform huge data lakes via security analytics and big data technologies into effective security intelligence presented through a security "cockpit" to achieve a better corporate security and compliance level, support sound risk management and informed decision making. We present a high-level architecture for efficient security intelligence and the concept of a security cockpit as a point of control for the corporate security and compliance state. Therefore, we could conclude nowadays corporate security can be perceived as a big-data problem.},

The biggest problem with the large data is the cost of processing. The equipment will have to be updated on a regular basis. So, it does not lose a minimal performance when the amount of data increases. The second problem is again related to the large amount of information that needs to be processed. BigData opens up new horizons for technology in planning production, education, healthcare and other industries.

abstract = {Nowadays, information technology has entered the era of big data. It is regarded as a revolution that will transform how we live, work and think. In the network era, a large number of data will be generated every day. Most of these data have the participation of our individual users, and the left data footprints can be gathered together to discover a lot of personal privacy. Big data can bring better work and life experience to users, however, it also brings the risk of personal privacy disclosure. This paper will use some theories of sociology, including anomie theory, social control theory, cultural conflict theory, and social exchange theory, to understand the knowledge of big data privacy, and point out some technologies that could solve out the problem: anonymity technology, data encryption technology, different privacy.},

This multi-case study of Australia, Ireland, Mexico, and U.S.A. examines the state of big data and big data analytics use in the national census context. The census agencies are at varying stages in digitally transforming their national census process, products and services through assimilating and using big data and big data analytics. The cross-case analysis of government websites and documents identified emerging agency challenges in creating public value in the national census context: (1) big data analytics capability development, (2) cross agency data access and data integration, and (3) data security, privacy &amp; trust. Based on the insights gained, a research model aims to postulate the possible links among challenges, big data/big data analytics use, and public value creation.},

abstract = {Transforming the latent value of big data into real value requires the great human intelligence and application of human-data scientists. Data scientists are expected to have a wide range of technical skills alongside being passionate self-directed people who are able to work easily with others and deliver high quality outputs under pressure. There are hundreds of university, commercial, and online courses in data science and related topics. Apart from people with breadth and depth of knowledge and experience in data science, we identify a new educational path to train "bridge persons" who combine knowledge of an organization's business with sufficient knowledge and understanding of data science to "bridge" between non-technical people in the business with highly skilled data scientists who add value to the business. The increasing proliferation of big data and the great advances made in data science do not herald in an era where all problems can be solved by deep learning and artificial intelligence. Although data science opens up many commercial and social opportunities, data science must complement other science in the search for new theory and methods to understand and manage our complex world.},

Therefore, how to monitor the large scale network traffic effectively has become an important challenge for network security management. Aiming at it, we propose a new network monitoring system where Netflow as the monitoring object based on big data technology, which has four main functions: it can use Filebeat to collect Netflow in real time; it transfers the data reliably based on Logstash; it stores the data in ElasticSearch, it analyzes and displays the data in real time through Kabana. The experimental results show that our system is capable of meeting millisecond responses to 100 million of Netflows. It can meet the requirements of real-time monitoring for large-scale network traffic, and provide the basis for network security control.},

abstract = {The benefits of deriving useful insights from avalanche of data available everywhere cannot be overemphasized. Big Data analytics can revolutionize the healthcare industry. It can also ensure functional productivity, help forecast and suggest feedbacks to disease outbreaks, enhance clinical practice, and optimize healthcare expenditure which cuts across all stakeholders in healthcare sectors. Notwithstanding these immense capabilities available in the general application of big data; studies on derivation of useful insights from healthcare data that can enhance medical practice have received little academic attention. Therefore, this study highlighted the possibility of making very insightful healthcare outcomes with big data through a simple classification problem which classifies the tendency of individuals towards specific drugs based on personality measures. Our model though trained with less than 2000 samples and with a simple neural network architecture achieved mean accuracies of 76.87% (sd=0.0097) and 75.86% (sd=0.0123) for the 0.15 and 0.05 validation sets respectively. The relatively acceptable performance recorded by our model despite the small dataset could largely be attributed to number of attributes in our dataset. It is essential to uncover some of the many complexities in our societies in relations to healthcare; and through many machine learning architectures like the neural networks these complex relationships can be discovered},

Decision makers often have psychological characteristics such as reference dependence, loss avoidance, and probability judgment distortion when making decisions. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-attribute group decision making method based on foreground theory and language decision information based on big data technology. The method makes full use of the qualitative and quantitative conversion characteristics of the cloud model, and solves the problems of ambiguity and randomness of emergency decision information. At the same time, based on the foreground theory, the influence of the psychological factors of the decision makers on the decision results is fully considered, and the emergency response is emergency. Management and decision making provide supplementary reference.},

abstract = {With the significant advances in communication technologies and in many other sectors, also are growing up security and privacy issues. In our research, is introduced a base technology called Cloud Computing (CC) to operate with the Big Data (BD). CC is a technology which refers to the processing power of data in the fog, providing more “green” computational and sustainable computing. Since it is a recently investigated technology, it has many gaps in security and privacy. So, in this paper, we proposed a new system for Cloud Computing integrated with Internet of Things as a base scenario for Big Data. Moreover, we tried to establish an architecture relaying on the security of the network in order to improve the security issues. A solution proposed is installing a security “wall” between the Cloud Server and the Internet, with the aim to eliminate the privacy and security issues. As a result, we consider that CC deals more efficient with the privacy issue of bits transferred through time. Through our proposed system, the interaction and cooperation between things and objects communicate through the wireless networks in order to fulfil the objective set to them as a combined entity. Regarding the major goal of our research, which is the security, a sort survey of IoT and CC presented, with a focus on the security issues of both technologies. In addition to this, we try present the security challenges of the integration of IoT and Cloud Computing with the aim to provide an architecture relaying on the security of the network in order to improve their security issues. Finally, we realize that through our study Cloud Computing could offer a more “green” and efficient fog environment for sustainable computing scenarios.}

This is because big data can provide unique insights into, inter alia, market trends, customer buying patterns, and maintenance cycles, as well as into ways of lowering costs and enabling more targeted business decisions. Realizing the importance of big data business analytics (BDBA), we review and classify the literature on the application of BDBA on logistics and supply chain management (LSCM) – that we define as supply chain analytics (SCA), based on the nature of analytics (descriptive, predictive, prescriptive) and the focus of the LSCM (strategy and operations). To assess the extent to which SCA is applied within LSCM, we propose a maturity framework of SCA, based on four capability levels, that is, functional, process-based, collaborative, agile SCA, and sustainable SCA. We highlight the role of SCA in LSCM and denote the use of methodologies and techniques to collect, disseminate, analyze, and use big data driven information. Furthermore, we stress the need for managers to understand BDBA and SCA as strategic assets that should be integrated across business activities to enable integrated enterprise business analytics. Finally, we outline the limitations of our study and future research directions.}
