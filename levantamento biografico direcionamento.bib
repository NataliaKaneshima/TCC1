abstract = {Brain-inspired AI (BI-AI) is the contemporary phase in the AI development that is concerned with the design and implementation of highly intelligent machines that utilise information processing principles from the human brain, along with their applications. Artificial neural networks (ANN), in their early developments world-wide (the first publication in Bulgarian was in 1990 [1] and then [2, 3])) were promising techniques for AI from the very beginning. But their full potential is just being realised through the latest brain-inspired spiking neural networks (SNN) and their deep learning algorithms, that make it possible for AI to gain a fast progress nowadays [3-14].This presentation has two parts. The first part covers generic methodological aspects of AI and neural networks, including: Learning evolving processes in space and time; Data, Information and Knowledge; The human brain as a deep learning system; Classical methods of ANN; Methods of SNN; Deep learning in brain-inspired SNN architectures; Evolutionary and quantum-inspired optimisation of SNN systems.The second part presents specific methods, systems and applications based on deep learning in SNN and BI-AI for various problems and data, including audio/visual data, brain EEG and fMRI data, Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI), Bio/Neuroinformatics data, Multisensory data for predictive modelling in ecology, environment, finance. It concludes with discussions about the future of computers and AI. A development software system NeuCube and application systems can be found on: http://www.kedri.aut.ac.nz/neucube/.

abstract = {The use of artificial intelligence in government and its implications to society have generated widespread interest from research and practice communities. However, the analysis of artificial intelligence techniques as a tool to support government decision-making in specific functions is still scarce. For instance, public budgeting could be considered one of the most important internal functions of government and, therefore, it is necessary to understand how artificial intelligence could impact this function. This paper explores the potential of artificial intelligence techniques to classify public budgeting allocations to different programs and policies. In order to achieve this, artificial neural networks and genetic algorithms are applied to budget data from the Mexican federal government. Among other specific actions, the results suggest that government decision makers should consider fostering investments in social and economic development, as well as increasing the budget in non-programmable expenses in order to activate the economy. Based on the results of this study, we argue that the use of artificial intelligence techniques in government, as a tool for data analysis, has the potential to support better decision-making in government. In our view, artificial intelligence should not be necessarily used to make the final decisions automatically, but to provide ideas and identify potential opportunities and different scenarios that government leaders can then assess and incorporate into their decision-making processes.},

This study aims to show the performance of several convolutional neural networks architectures applied to the diagnosis and screening of skin lesions in patients using different training techniques: Random weights initialization, feature extraction and extending model. A dataset of 1000 clinical images proven by biopsy or consensus among specialists were the examples applied at the various architectures which were end-to-end trained from images directly, using only pixels and disease labels as inputs. The predictions provided from the models intended to claim whether the lesion could be treated by doctors with images only on a teledermatology approach or if it is necessary to prescribe a biopsy or referral to a face-to-face consultation. The model can also tell the urgency of the case and the group of diseases which that lesion belongs to. Performances of deep neural networks in all proposed tasks demonstrated that artificial intelligence has the potential to perform the screening of skin lesions with a level of competence comparable to dermatologists. It is projected 6.3 billion signatures of smartphone by the year 2021 [38]. Therefore, deep neural networks incorporated in mobile devices can amplify the reach of dermatologists outside their offices providing universal low-cost access to dermatological diagnostics.},

In light of these limitations, this paper proposes an active TUI framework that addresses the challenges experienced in teaching and learning artificial intelligence (AI) within higher educational institutions. The proposal extends an aptly designed tabletop TUI architecture with the novel interactive paradigm of active tangible manipulatives to provide a more engaging and effective user interaction. The paper describes the deployment of the proposed TUI framework within an undergraduate laboratory session to aid in the teaching and learning of artificial neural networks. The experiment is assessed against currently adopted educational computer software and the obtained results highlight the potential of the proposed TUI framework to augment students? gain in knowledge and understanding of abstracted threshold concepts in higher education.},

abstract = {Explainability and accuracy of the machine learning algorithms usually laid on a trade-off relationship. Several algorithms such as deep-learning artificial neural networks have high accuracy but low explainability. Since there were only limited ways to access the learning and prediction processes in algorithms, researchers and users were not able to understand how the results were given to them. However, a recent project, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) by DARPA, showed that AI systems can be highly explainable but also accurate. Several technical reports of XAI suggested ways of extracting explainable features and their positive effects on users; the results showed that explainability of AI was helpful to make users understand and trust the system. However, only a few studies have addressed why the explainability can bring positive effects to users. We suggest theoretical reasons from the attribution theory and anthropomorphism studies. Trough a review, we develop three hypotheses: (1) causal attribution is a human nature and thus a system which provides casual explanation on their process will affect users to attribute the result of system; (2) Based on the attribution results, users will perceive the system as human-like and which will be a motivation of anthropomorphism; (3) The system will be perceived by the users through the anthropomorphism. We provide a research framework for designing causal explainability of an AI system and discuss the expected results of the research.},

The initial weight given randomly is the most widely used method when training neural networks. However, randomly given initial weights are independent of the samples. A weight initialization method associated with samples for deep feedforward neural network (DFFNN) is proposed. The initial weights set by this method are a combination of the original weights given randomly and the weights obtained by the first epoch training. The initial weights not only have random characteristics, but are also closely related to the samples to be trained. The proposed method is tested with the bearing data provided by the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) Bearing Data Center. The testing results show that the proposed method can accelerate the training of DFFNN to some extent.},

KDN seeks to leverage Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques for the control and operation of computer networks. KDN extends Software Defined Networking (SDN) with advanced telemetry and network analytics introducing a so-called Knowledge Plane. The proposed ANN is capable of predicting the network performance according to traffic parameters by creating a model of traffic behavior based on bandwidth and latency measurements over different paths. The method includes training the ANN model to choose the path with least load. We conduct a series of experiments in an emulated environment to validate the proposed method.

In this study, IoT sensor data was collected at the restored Woljeong Bridge, which was originally built in the eighth century, or AD 760, during the Silla Dynasty (57 BC--AD 935) in South Korea. We empirically evaluate a recurrent neural network with recurrent units, including a long short-term memory (LSTM) unit and a gated recurrent unit (GRU). Additionally, we evaluate hybrid deep-learning models (convolution neural networks [CNN]-LSTM and CNN-GRU) to build a prediction model, facilitating the preventive conservation of an invaluable cultural and national heritage site. The experimental results show that the LSTM unit is an effective and robust model. When comparing the hybrid models (i.e., the joint CNN-LSTM and CNN-GRU architectures), we found that the vanilla LSTM and GRU models had superior time-series prediction capabilities.},

The smart networks are characterized with heterogeneity, structural complexity, and dynamic topology that are causing the new security threats. For them, the conventional methods of intrusion detection take a poor effect.

abstract = {Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved excellent performance on various artificial intelligence (AI) applications, while a higher demand on energy efficiency is required for future AI. Resistive Random-Access Memory (RRAM)-based computing system provides a promising solution to energy-efficient neural network training. However, it's difficult to support high-precision CNN in RRAM-based hardware systems. Firstly, multi-bit digital-analog interfaces will take up most energy overhead of the whole system. Secondly, it's difficult to write the RRAM to expected resistance states accurately; only low-precision numbers can be represented. To enable CNN training based on RRAM, we propose a low-bitwidth CNN training method, using low-bitwidth convolution outputs (CO), activations (A), weights (W) and gradients (G) to train CNN models based on RRAM. Furthermore, we design a system to implement the training algorithms. We explore the accuracy under different bitwidth combinations of (A,CO,W,G), and propose a practical tradeoff between accuracy and energy overhead. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed system perform well on low-bitwidth CNN training tasks. For example, training LeNet-5 with 4-bit convolution outputs, 4-bit weights, 4-bit activations and 4-bit gradients on MNIST can still achieve 97.67% accuracy. Moreover, the proposed system can achieve 23.0X higher energy efficiency than GPU when processing the training task of LeNet-5, and 4.4X higher energy efficiency when processing the training task of ResNet-20.},

It is important to have a set of effective and reliable methods to detect malicious attacks to ensure the security of AI models. Such standardized methods can also serve as a reference for researchers to develop robust models and new kinds of attacks. This study proposes a method to assess the robustness of AI models. Six commonly used image classification CNN models were evaluated when subjected to 13 types of adversarial attacks. The robustness of the models is calculated unbiased and can be used as a reference for further improvement. It is distinguished from prior related works that our algorithm is attack-agnostic and is applicable to neural network model.},

In our ongoing effort to identify principles endowing the astrocyte with unique functions in brain computation, and translate them into neural-astrocytic networks (NANs), we propose a biophysically realistic model of an astrocyte that preserves the experimentally observed spatial allocation of its distinct subcellular compartments. We show how our model may encode, and modulate, the extent of synchronous neural activity via calcium waves that propagate intracellularly across the astrocytic compartments. This relationship between neural activity and astrocytic calcium waves has long been speculated but it is still lacking a mechanistic explanation. Our model suggests an astrocytic "calcium cascade" mechanism for neuronal synchronization, which may empower NANs by imposing periodic neural modulation known to reduce coding errors. By expanding our notions of information processing in astrocytes, our work aims to solidify a computational role for non-neuronal cells and incorporate them into artificial networks.},

abstract = {Recently Pretrained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have proven its effectiveness in image extraction and classification. This powerful feature of CNNs in image processing is facilitated by machine learning to train and classify big data. Image capturing and security transformation are considered as a central necessity of remote sensing imagery of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and drones. This paper presents a novel artificial intelligent drone-based encrypted machine learning of image classification using a pertained CNN and image encryption-decryption by utilizing singular value decomposition (SVD) and XOR-Secret-Key block cipher cryptology. Initially, pretrained convolutional neural networks (CNN) are extensively used to extract and classify image features making advantage of machine learning training tools features. Training of partial set of image data can be performed to test, classify and label the untrained image data. Pretrained CNN can classify images into object categories. Afterward, the CNN the classified image output is transformed into a digital matrix using SVD and identifies its associated eigenvalues. These eigenvalues are then converted into a binary code. The image data encryption is implemented according to suggested keys. The first part applies the exclusive OR (XOR) operation of the eigenvalues with a selected cipher key. Meanwhile, the second part implements the XOR operation of the output of part one with a randomly generated key using Poisson distribution. The last step in the encryption will be obtained by generating a non-real SVD decomposition matrix; according to which a non-readable image will be resulted. The original image-matrix can be constructed by reversing the process using the security key-cipher block (Poisson Distribution Key and Stand-alone Cipher Code). Finally, SVD image processing results are demonstrated to verify the effectiveness and security of the applied approach that can be implemented for different images.},

abstract = {Deep Learning is moving to edge devices, ushering in a new age of distributed Artificial Intelligence (AI). The high demand of computational resources required by deep neural networks may be alleviated by approximate computing techniques, and most notably reduced-precision arithmetic with coarsely quantized numerical representations. In this context, Bonseyes comes in as an initiative to enable stakeholders to bring AI to low-power and autonomous environments such as: Automotive, Medical Healthcare and Consumer Electronics. To achieve this, we introduce LPDNN, a framework for optimized deployment of Deep Neural Networks on heterogeneous embedded devices. In this work, we detail the quantization engine that is integrated in LPDNN. The engine depends on a fine-grained workflow which enables a Neural Network Design Exploration and a sensitivity analysis of each layer for quantization. We demonstrate the engine with a case study on Alexnet and VGG16 for three different techniques for direct quantization: standard fixed-point, dynamic fixed-point and k-means clustering, and demonstrate the potential of the latter. We argue that using a Gaussian quantizer with k-means clustering can achieve better performance than linear quantizers. Without retraining, we achieve over 55.64% saving for weights' storage and 69.17% for run-time memory accesses with less than 1% drop in top5 accuracy in Imagenet.},

abstract = {The global financial crisis of 2008 has led to the increased scrutiny of governance and conduct of financial services firms. A key component of monitoring conduct within this area is Financial Services Compliance Management. Financial institutions need to adhere to legislation such as the European MiFID II and GDPR through to anti-money laundering compliance. A recent report by Thomson Routers in 2018 has found through a survey with 800 financial firms that 66% of firms expect the cost of senior compliance staff to increase, up from 60% of firms in 2017, indicating a continuing growth in spending on compliance. Effective solutions need to be in place to mitigate these increasing costs while enhancing the compliance workflow. Doing this would provide a market edge. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have been gaining traction within the compliance management domain from both regulators and financial institutions in areas such as trade and market surveillance to regulatory compliance assurance. These areas share a commonality in terms of the volume of data to monitor often in real-time and from disparate sources both structured and unstructured with an emphasis on ensuring data quality and handling underlying bias in data. In this paper, an overview of the key use case areas of AI and ML in the compliance management domain will be provided. Detailed analysis on the application of specific AI solutions such as natural language processing, data discovery and generative modelling is introduced.},

We analyze the representations learned by neural machine translation (NMT) models at various levels of granularity and evaluate their quality through relevant extrinsic properties. In particular, we seek answers to the following questions: (i) How accurately is word structure captured within the learned representations, which is an important aspect in translating morphologically rich languages? (ii) Do the representations capture long-range dependencies, and effectively handle syntactically divergent languages? (iii) Do the representations capture lexical semantics? We conduct a thorough investigation along several parameters: (i) Which layers in the architecture capture each of these linguistic phenomena; (ii) How does the choice of translation unit (word, character, or subword unit) impact the linguistic properties captured by the underlying representations? (iii) Do the encoder and decoder learn differently and independently? (iv) Do the representations learned by multilingual NMT models capture the same amount of linguistic information as their bilingual counterparts? Our data-driven, quantitative evaluation illuminates important aspects in NMT models and their ability to capture various linguistic phenomena. We show that deep NMT models trained in an end-to-end fashion, without being provided any direct supervision during the training process, learn a non-trivial amount of linguistic information. Notable findings include the following observations: (i) Word morphology and part-of-speech information are captured at the lower layers of the model; (ii) In contrast, lexical semantics or non-local syntactic and semantic dependencies are better represented at the higher layers of the model; (iii) Representations learned using characters are more informed about word-morphology compared to those learned using subword units; and (iv) Representations learned by multilingual models are richer compared to bilingual models.},

abstract = {With the rapid progress of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, multi-modal deep neural networks (DNNs) have been applied to some challenging tasks, e.g., image and video description to process multi-modal information from vision and language. Resistive-memory-based processing-in-memory (ReRAM-based PIM) has been extensively studied to accelerate either convolutional neural network (CNN) or recurrent neural network (RNN). According to the requirements of their core layers, i.e. convolutional layers and linear layers, the existing ReRAM-based PIMs adopt different optimization schemes for them. Directly deploying multi-modal DNNs on the existing ReRAM-based PIMs, however, is inefficient because multi-modal DNNs have combined CNN and RNN where the primary layers differ depending on the specific tasks. Therefore, a high-efficiency ReRAM-based PIM design for multi-modal DNNs necessitates an adaptive optimization to the given network. In this work, we propose HitM, a high-throughput ReRAM-based PIM for multi-modal DNNs with a two-stage workflow, which consists of a static analysis and an adaptive optimization. The static analysis generates the layer-wise resource and computation information with the input multi-modal DNN description and the adaptive optimization produces a high-throughput ReRAM-based PIM design through the dynamic algorithm based on hardware resources and the information from the static analysis. We evaluated HitM using several popular multi-modal DNNs with different parameters and structures and compared it with a na\"{\i}ve ReRAM-based PIM design and an optimal-throughput ReRAM-based PIM design that assumes no hardware resource limitations. The experimental results show that HitM averagely achieves 78.01% of the optimal throughput while consumes 64.52% of the total hardware resources.},

abstract = {With the development of high computational devices, deep neural networks (DNNs), in recent years, have gained significant popularity in many Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications. However, previous efforts have shown that DNNs are vulnerable to strategically modified samples, named adversarial examples. These samples are generated with some imperceptible perturbations, but can fool the DNNs to give false predictions. Inspired by the popularity of generating adversarial examples against DNNs in Computer Vision (CV), research efforts on attacking DNNs for Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications have emerged in recent years. However, the intrinsic difference between image (CV) and text (NLP) renders challenges to directly apply attacking methods in CV to NLP. Various methods are proposed addressing this difference and attack a wide range of NLP applications. In this article, we present a systematic survey on these works. We collect all related academic works since the first appearance in 2017. We then select, summarize, discuss, and analyze 40 representative works in a comprehensive way. To make the article self-contained, we cover preliminary knowledge of NLP and discuss related seminal works in computer vision. We conclude our survey with a discussion on open issues to bridge the gap between the existing progress and more robust adversarial attacks on NLP DNNs.},

abstract = {Machine learning, especially deep learning has aroused interests of researchers and practitioners for the last few years in development of intelligent systems such as speech, natural language, and image processing. Software solutions based on machine learning techniques attract more attention as alternatives to conventional software systems. In this paper, we investigate how reusability techniques are applied in implementation of artificial neural networks (ANNs). We conducted an empirical study with an online survey among experts with experience in developing solutions with ANNs. We analyze the feedback of more than 100 experts to our survey. The results show existing challenges and some of the applied solutions in an intersection between reusability and ANNs.},

abstract = {In this paper, we build and describe a convolutional neural network protection method of Lenet-5-like structure. The protected convolutional neural network is obtained by adding the protection lock module in forward propagation algorithm in different layers so that unauthorized user can not use protected convolutional neural network of Lenet-5-like structure. The experimental results show that protection lock module be added in first and middle layers would gain the best protection effect. Authorized users can use protected convolutional neural network of Lenet-5-like structure after adding unlocking module. The accuracy of unlocked convolutional neural network is not affected by adding protection lock module and unlocking module. To add protection lock module realize protection on the convolutional neural network of Lenet-5-like structure.},

abstract = {As Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques become more powerful and easier to use they are increasingly deployed as key components of modern software systems. While this enables new functionality and often allows better adaptation to user needs it also creates additional problems for software engineers and exposes companies to new risks. Some work has been done to better understand the interaction between Software Engineering and AI but we lack methods to classify ways of applying AI in software systems and to analyse and understand the risks this poses. Only by doing so can we devise tools and solutions to help mitigate them. This paper presents the AI in SE Application Levels (AI-SEAL) taxonomy that categorises applications according to their point of application, the type of AI technology used and the automation level allowed. We show the usefulness of this taxonomy by classifying 15 papers from previous editions of the RAISE workshop. Results show that the taxonomy allows classification of distinct AI applications and provides insights concerning the risks associated with them. We argue that this will be important for companies in deciding how to apply AI in their software applications and to create strategies for its use.},

abstract = {Managing the ever increasing road traffic congestion due to enormous vehicular growth is a big concern all over the world. Tremendous air pollution, loss of valuable time and money are the common consequences of traffic congestion in urban areas. IoT based Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) can help in managing the road traffic congestion in an efficient way. Estimation and classification of the traffic congestion state of different road segments is one of the important aspects of intelligent traffic management. Traffic congestion state recognition of different road segments helps the traffic management authority to optimize the traffic regulation of a transportation system. The commuters can also decide their best possible route to the destination based on traffic congestion state of different road segments. This paper aims to estimate and classify the traffic congestion state of different road segments within a city by analyzing the road traffic data captured by in-road stationary sensors. The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based system is used to classify traffic congestion states. Based on traffic congestion status, ITS will automatically update the traffic regulations like, changing the queue length in traffic signal, suggesting alternate routes. It also helps the government to device policies regarding construction of flyover/alternate route for better traffic management.},

abstract = {The amount of historical photographs is a challenge for archives with regard to analyzing, documenting and structuring archival material and make it retrievable and accessible. Established human centric concepts will not be able to handle the instream of un- or semi-structured material or handle analogue documentation. We suggest the use of artificial intelligence to pre-classify and organize historic photographs in collections and archives. With regard to uncertainty the concept of artificial intelligence based classification is discussed based on two questions: (1) What is the uncertainty in current archival documentation, assuming that the quality and completeness of a current classification depends on the partial and restricted knowledge of a person? (2) Can algorithmic concepts help to quantify the level of uncertainty? The aspect of documentation is discussed based on a comparison of algorithms and classical processes. The contribution of artificial intelligence to quantify the uncertainty is tested in a case study. For this an artificial neural network / convolutional neural network was trained and tested on a collection of historical photographs.},

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become the buzzword of the last decade. Advances so far have been largely technical with a focus on machine learning (ML). Only recently have we begun seeing a shift towards focusing on the human aspects of artificial intelligence, centered on the narrow view of making AI interactive and explainable. In this paper I suggest a definition for "Interactive Human Centered Artificial Intelligence and outline the required properties. Staying in control is essential for humans to feel safe and have self-determination. Hence, we need to find ways for humans to understand AI based systems and means to allow human control and oversight. In our work, we argue that levels of abstractions and granularity of control are a general solution to this. Furthermore, it is essential that we make explicit why we want AI and what are the goals of AI research and development. We need to state the properties that we expect of future intelligent systems and who will benefit from a system or service. For me, AI and ML are very much comparable to raw materials (like stone, iron, or bronze). Historical periods are named after these materials as they fundamentally changed what humans can build and what tools humans can engineer. Hence, I argue that in the AI age we need to shift the focus from the material (e.g. the AI algorithms, as there will be plenty of material) towards the tools and infrastructures that are enabled which are beneficial to humans. It is apparent that AI will allow the automation of mental routine tasks and that it will extend our ability to perceive the world and foresee events. For me, the central question is how to create these tools for amplifying the human mind without compromising human values.},

abstract = {Binary Neural Networks (BNNs), whose weights and activations can be represented by a single bit, are gaining more and more attention. Because their inference speed and memory consumption are far superior to full-precision neural networks. However, the previous work on BNNs often leads to severe accuracy degradation. To address this issue, we propose a novel BNN model named Binary Densely Connected Network (BDCN), which connects each mlpconv (a multilayer perceptron to extract better features) layer to all preceding mlpconv layers. Such enhanced dense connection can strengthen the representation capabilities of BNN, which is beneficial to improve the accuracy of the network. This work further narrows the accuracy gap between BNNs and their full-precision counterpart. We evaluate our BDCN on a range of visual datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet) and find that our method outperforms other state-of-art binary networks whilst keeping the model size acceptable.},
